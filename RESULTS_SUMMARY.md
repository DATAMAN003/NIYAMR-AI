## 🎓 Key Insights

### What the Act Does:
- Alters universal credit rates for tax years 2026-27 to 2029-30
- Increases standard allowance by CPI + uplift percentage
- Freezes LCWRA and LCW elements with exceptions for certain claimants
- Protects pre-2026 claimants from rate reductions
- Makes corresponding provisions for Northern Ireland

### What's Missing:
- Explicit enforcement/penalty provisions (may be in referenced regulations)
- Specific record-keeping requirements (may be in referenced regulations)

**Note**: The Act primarily amends existing regulations rather than creating new standalone provisions, which explains why some elements reference other Acts.
